    description: "The Strattos S5 is Polygon's top of the line alloy frame / carbon fork road bike and is aimed at avid road cyclists, sportive regulars and everyday commuters. This bike combines a lightweight, durable and reliable alloy frame with the proven performance and popularity of the Shimano 105 22 speed gear set. The Strattos frame is made of Polygon's new ALX Performance 6061 Hydroformed Aluminum which is now only 2.9 lbs (almost 1 lb lighter than last years Strattos frame) and has been designed for improved bump absorption and vibration compliance. Also, used in high performance cars, hydroforming injects fluid into a cylindrical frame tube to manipulate into a more beneficial shape which allows Polygon to reduce weight and increase stiffness in the key areas of the frame to improve ride quality. The frame is constructed with super smooth, double welded joints. The first weld is used for strength, then using a die grinder it is ground back to which a second weld is added to fill in any gaps. Lastly, the final grind and polish are applied, to give the frame joints an almost carbon like appearance. Not only does this frame look like carbon and ride like carbon, it still also provides the incredible value of Aluminum.",

    description: `The new 2021 Polygon Siskiu D7 has become one of the most popular and highest selling dual-suspension bikes for Polygon. Capitalizing on extensive R & D, state of the art testing facilities, and feedback from top-level riders, the Polygon Sikiu D7 defies what an outstanding value dual-suspension mountain bike is capable of. This year's host of upgrades tick all the boxes for those looking for a bike with modern geometry, great XC pedaling efficiency, and all-mountain capability.
      
      The D7 is built around a lightweight, ALX aluminum boost frame that boasts a modern rider's modern geometry. The bike now has a slacker head tube angle, more extended reach, lower BB, and shorter chain-stay to boost your performance in climbing or to descend, no matter the distance, technicality, or gradient. Polygon has also revised kinematics on the Siskiu D. The anti-squat has been optimized, and the suspension is more progressive. It has 120mm of travel in the rear, with a one-piece linkage system that reduces lateral flex in the rear triangle and improves the linear movement and performance of the shock. The frame now also comes with room for a water bottle mount.`,

    description: `Designed for children who've outgrown their 20 inch bike and are ready to further explore their neighborhood and gain independence, the Polygon Premier 24 is the ideal lightweight all-terrain bike for your 7 to 11-year-old. As they venture further into their widening world, the practicality of a lightweight bike combined with intuitive gearing and hassle-free, safe v-brakes lets them focus on the adventure and gives us parents peace of mind. 

      The frame is made of ultralight 6061 Aluminum tubing and features confidence-inspiring geometry where the low center of gravity and 70-degree head angle provides the ideal balance of low-speed agility and high-speed stability; 'look mum no hands!'. The Premier 24 utilizes an ultralight, rigid fork instead of a hefty suspension fork, reducing the weight by 4 pounds and giving your child independence rather than holding them back. The lightweight quest continues with an aluminum handlebar, stem, seat post, crankset, hubs, and rims, components all too often weighed down by cheaper steel.`,
